# Rental searching

## Description   
Bot looks through https://www.bezrealitky.cz/ and filtering all apartments meeting desired conditions.   
After that, bot download each adress, price and url of these apartments.   
Next Bot opens Google Form and fill each aparment information and send.   

## What's next?

And after that there're useful addons like SheetGo and Remove Duplicates, which helps me find out if there're any new offers.
